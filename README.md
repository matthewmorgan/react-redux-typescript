# React-Redux-Typescript Starter Project

With support for Jest and Redux Dev Tools

Originally built with `create-react-app` (see README-CRA.md)

I created this version because I couldn't find a current version of such a thing.

I fleshed out the Redux parts by following the docs for Microsoft's typescript-react-redux [starter kit](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter)

Modifications that I made include:
- simplifying the project generally
- updating dependencies
- fixing deprecated calls
- changing some of the linting config
- getting the app to run with all those updates
- plugging in the Redux Dev Tools
